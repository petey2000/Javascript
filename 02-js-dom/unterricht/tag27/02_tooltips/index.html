          right now, there are billions of <span class="keyword">neurons</span> working like crazy
          so you exist. And the neat thing about these neurons is how we've
          <span class="keyword">hijacked</span> a bunch of them into reading these words. Think of
          all the areas of your brain we are commandeering right now!
          <span class="keyword">Poop</span>. We just made you read the word poop. We might also have
          caused memories and images of <span class="keyword">poop</span> to plop through your
          brain. Whew, such power. To celebrate the power of our headiest of organs, we bring you
          these awesome Brain <span class="keyword">Specimen</span> Coasters.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each set of Brain
          <span class="keyword">Specimen</span> Coasters comes with ten glass coasters. Each coaster
          has four rubber feet (to further protect the surfaces the coasters are protecting in the
          first place) and a slice of brain printed on it. If you stack your Brain Specimen Coasters
          in the proper order (which is easy to do, since the coasters are labeled) and look from
          the proper angle, you'll see a full brain. Plus, if you use your Brain Specimen Coasters
          at your next science party, your friends will know how thoughtful you really are. Get it?
          Brain Specimen Coasters? Thoughtful? Uhhh.... <span class="keyword">poop</span>.
